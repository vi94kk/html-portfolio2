<h1>SPIRITUAL SPACE- INNER SLEF</h1>
<h2>The spiritual space has been divided into two distinct areas.<br />
Their main purpose is to help people temporarily detach from digital reality, and re-establish a mental and physical connection with themselves.
</h2>
<h3>THE GARDEN</h3>
- A wide variety of plant species and plenty of sunlight<br />
- With a narrow winding path to form a small forest<br />
- Enjoy the nature and relax yourself in your own inner world<br />
<h3>MEDITATION WATER ROOM</h3>
- Water throughout the space and waterfall sound-stress reduction<br />
- Sun reflection through the water skylight<br />
- A quiet place where people can meditate and think deeply<br />
- The frosted glass at the entrance provides privacy<br />
<h4>ADMINISTRATION</h4>
